# Quake 2 - Celeste Mod (more like I accidentally made an Ultrakill mod)

## Description:

Celeste, a 2D platformer game, has a lot of unique movement features and obstacles that makes it more distinct from other platformers. However, Celeste is obviously not made to work in an FPS environment, but this mod tries to create an experience as if it were meant for that. To comply with the deliverables, the features added to this mod aren't specific to Celeste, involving ideas from myself or inspiration from other movement shooters. 

## Download Instructions:

Download the 'mods' folder from Releases
Unzip mods and then place the folder in your Quake 2 folder (Usually located here: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 2)
If necessary, go to the Properties of the 'quake2 - MOD' and change the directory to be your Quake2 directory inside the 'Target:' bar so that you can actually play the mod (DONT CHANGE +set game mods)

**NOTE: This mod does NOT work with the remastered version. If opening the mod with the shortcut provided with the folder somehow opened the remastered version, you can follow an alternate method if you own the game on Steam. Unfortunately, this is the only other way I know of.**
### Alternate Play Instructions:

If you don't want to open the game this way or the shortcut opened the remastered version, you can launch the game through Steam instead:
1. Find Quake 2 in your Steam library and right click on it then go to properties as shown in the image below:

2. Navigate to the 'General' tab on the sidebar, then look for the Launch Options.
3. The default setting is to 'Ask when starting game'. You must click on that and switch it to 'Play Quake II original'.
4. For the actual launch options, they act as a shortcut to open the game, so just like manually making a shortcut to the mod, add the parameters '+set game mods' to the launch options

## How To Play

This mod does NOT work with the remastered version. If you opened the mod with the remastered version, open the console (CTRL + ALT + `) and type in "game quake2" to go back to the original version
